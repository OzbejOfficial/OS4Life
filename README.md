# OS CHEAT SHEET
### repository for operation systems

## !! HOTFIX NEEDEED: Wait for cheat sheet to be updated with command seq in bash, or just write it down yourself.

As of 7. 6. 2023 you can have first side printed and the other one handwritten. The one document to be printed and is probably found most useful is _OS\_CheatSheet\_Reduced\_LatestVersion_.

Good luck on the exam.
